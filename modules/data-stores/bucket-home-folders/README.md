# S3 Bucket

This folder contains an example [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configuration that defines a module for deploying a S3 Bucket (using [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)) in an [Amazon Web Services (AWS) account](http://aws.amazon.com/).

## Quick start

Terraform modules are not meant to be deployed directly. Instead, you should be including them in other Terraform configurations. See [examples/data-stores/s3](../../../examples/data-stores/s3/) for examples.
