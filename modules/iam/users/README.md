# IAM Users

This folder contains an example [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configuration that defines a module for creating IAM users(using [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)) in an [Amazon Web Services (AWS) account](http://aws.amazon.com/).

## Quick start

Terraform modules are not meant to be deployed directly. Instead, you should be including them in other Terraform configurations. See [examples/iam/users](../../../examples/iam/users/) for examples.
